	<p>
		I'm a fourth year PhD student at the <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/">Centre for Language Evolution</a> 
		(<a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>), 
		supervised by <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/">Simon Kirby</a>,
		<a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/">Kenny Smith</a>,
		and <a href="http://www.crcummins.com/">Chris Cummins</a>.
		
		<br />
		<br />
		In my PhD I use agent-based models to formalise and explore the hypothesis that language and mindreading 
		(a.k.a. theory of mind) have co-evolved.
		More specifically, I explore under what circumstances such a co-evolution could have gotten off the ground, 
		given certain sets of assumptions about how agents communicate and learn, 
		and about what cognitive biases and external pressures are at play.
