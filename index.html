		I recently finished my PhD with a thesis titled "Co-evolution of language and mindreading: A computational exploration",
		at the <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/">Centre for Language Evolution</a> (University of Edinburgh), supervised by
		<a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/">Simon Kirby</a>,
		<a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/">Kenny Smith</a>,
		and <a href="http://www.crcummins.com/">Chris Cummins</a>. Find a pdf of my doctoral thesis
		<A HREF="https://github.com/marieke-woensdregt/marieke-woensdregt.github.io/blob/master/pdfs/Thesis_M_Woensdregt_Co-Evolution_of_Language_and_Mindreading.pdf">here</a>.

		<br />
		In my PhD I used agent-based models to formalise and explore the hypothesis that language and mindreading 
		(a.k.a. theory of mind) have co-evolved.
		More specifically, I explored under what circumstances such a co-evolution could have gotten off the ground, 
		given different assumptions about how language users and learners work, 
		and what pressures may be at play in the cultural transmission of language.
