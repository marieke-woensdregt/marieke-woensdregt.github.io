		I'm a computational cognitive scientist who researches the interplay between language, inference, social cognition, 
		and social interaction. I currently work as assistant professor at the 
		<a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/faculty-of-social-sciences/donders-centre-for-cognition">Donders Centre for Cognition</a> and 
		Artificial Intelligence Department of 
		<a href="https://www.ru.nl/en">Radboud University</a>, in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

		[here]</a>.
		Language use relies on (i) flexible inferencing skills (e.g. to combine linguistic knowledge
		and background knowledge to infer the meaning of a novel word like mask-shaming); (ii)
		socio-cognitive skills such as theory of mind (e.g., to decide whether to talk about the house
		or a house), and (iii) interactional skills (e.g., to ask for clarification). I use computational
		modelling to tackle challenging questions about these capacities and their interplay.
