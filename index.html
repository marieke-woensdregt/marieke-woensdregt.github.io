	<h3>Modelling Metacommunication and Repair</h3>
	<p>
		I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, where I work with 
		<a href="https://markdingemanse.net/">Mark Dingemanse</a>
		on his NWO Vidi project titled 
		<a href="https://markdingemanse.net/elpaco/">'Elementary particles of conversation'</a>, in which we study pragmatics, error-tolerance and complexity in language. 
		Within this project I am using computational modelling to explore how communicative repair and other 
		strategies for streamlining communication could have emerged during language evolution, and 
		how their emergence affects linguistic structure and process.

	<h3>Modelling the Co-Evolution of Language and Mindreading</h3>
	<p>	
		In April 2019 I defended my PhD thesis titled 'Co-evolution of language and mindreading: 
		A computational exploration'.
		My PhD was supervised by <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/">Simon Kirby</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/">Kenny Smith</a> and 
		<a href="http://www.crcummins.com/">Chris Cummins</a>
		at the <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/">Centre for Language Evolution</a>,
		University of Edinburgh.
		Find a pdf of my doctoral thesis
		<a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/35944">
		here</a>.
		
		<br />
		<br />
		In my PhD I used agent-based models to formalise and explore the hypothesis that language and mindreading 
		(a.k.a. theory of mind) have co-evolved.
		More specifically, I explored under what circumstances such a co-evolution could have gotten off the ground, 
		given different assumptions about how language users and learners work, 
		and what pressures may be at play in the cultural transmission of language.
