	<p>
		I'm a computational cognitive scientist who researches the interplay between language, inference, social cognition, 
		and social interaction.
		Language use relies on (i) flexible inferencing skills (e.g. to combine linguistic knowledge
		and background knowledge to infer the meaning of a novel word like mask-shaming); (ii)
		socio-cognitive skills such as theory of mind (e.g., to decide whether to talk about the house
		or a house), and (iii) interactional skills (e.g., to ask for clarification). I use computational
		modelling to tackle challenging questions about these capacities and their interplay.
