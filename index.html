		I'm a 3rd year PhD student in the <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/">Centre for Language Evolution</a> 
		at the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>, 
		supervised by <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/">Simon Kirby</a>,
		<a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/">Kenny Smith</a>,
		and <a href="http://www.crcummins.com/">Chris Cummins</a>.
		<br />
		In my PhD I use agent-based models to formalise and explore the hypothesis that language and mindreading (a.k.a. theory of mind) have co-evolved.
		More specifically, I explore under what circumstances such a co-evolution could have come off the ground, 
		given certain sets of assumptions about how agents communicate and learn, and what cognitive biases and external pressures play a role.
		<br />
