	<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
	<p>
		In my spare time I like to be involved in projects that have to do with community gardens and permaculture. 
		Aside from my PhD I have a post as a sessional worker with the charity  
		<a href="http://cyrenians.scot/">Cyrenians</a>, where I work together with patients of the 
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/AstleyAinslieHospital/Pages/default.aspx">Astley Ainslie Hospital</a> 
		to breathe new life into their hospital garden. This is a rehabilitation hospital for people who suffer from
		acquired brain injury, stroke, orthopaedic injuries, limb amputation, or other progressive neurological disorders.
		In this 6-month project we will re-design and re-plant their hospital garden, which has been neglected over the years, 
		based on the patients' own needs and wishes, while working together with all patients, staff and visitors who feel
		like helping.
		
		<br />
		<br />
		Before starting this project with the Astley Ainslie Hospital, I was a patient-engagement volunteer for 
		<a href="http://cyrenians.scot/">Cyrenians</a>,
		where I did gardening and other nature-based activities with patients who were staying at the acute wards of the 
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/REH/Pages/default.aspx">Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Mental Health</a>.
		Both outside in the <a href="http://cyrenians.scot/community-and-food/community-gardens/">Royal Edinburgh Community Garden</a>
		which is located on the hospital grounds, and inside on the wards, where we brought some of the garden along with us.

		From September to December 2014 I spent 3 months in Bamenda, Cameroon, where I volunteered for the NGO 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a>. 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a> works to promote permaculture 
		practices in rural Cameroon, and to connect modern permaculture knowledge with the traditional practices and know-how
		of small-scale farmers. For this purpose, <a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a> 
		has a permaculture demonstration site called 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/ndanifor-permaculture-ecovillage/">Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage</a>,
		near Alegnwi village in the rural region of Bafut, and are setting up a cooperative called
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/introducing-betterworld-cameroon/bettercoop-permaculture/"> Better Coop</a>
		to sell the farm's produce.
		In rural Cameroon, small-scale vegetable gardens are usually 
		cultivated by women, for own consumption but also for selling at the local market. These women have a wealth of 
		knowledge of the local plants, soil and climate, and how these interact. Therefore, in cultivating and doing 
		natural building at 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/ndanifor-permaculture-ecovillage/">Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage</a>, 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a> 
		works together with a local women's group, but also with local builders, 
		<a href="http://africa.iclei.org/members/members-in-africa/profiled-african-members/bafut-council-cameroon.html">Bafut Council</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.wmf.org/project/bafut-palace">Bafut Palace</a>, natural builder 
		<a href="http://elkecole.com/">Elke Cole</a>,
		and the <a href="https://ecovillage.org/">Global Ecovillage Network</a>.
		As a volunteer for <a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a> 
		I worked in the office in Bamenda for 4 days a week doing all kinds of organisational development work, 
		and at the <a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/ndanifor-permaculture-ecovillage/">Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage</a>
		for 2 days a week learning about permaculture, local farming practices and natural building.
