	<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
	<p>
		In my spare time I like to be involved in community garden projects. Aside from my PhD I have a post as a sessional worker with 
		<a href="http://cyrenians.scot/">Cyrenians</a>, where I work together with patients of the 
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/AstleyAinslieHospital/Pages/default.aspx">Astley Ainslie Hospital</a> 
		to breathe new life into their hospital garden. This is a rehabilitation hospital for people who have suffered 
		brain injury, a stroke, orthopaedic injuries, limb amputation, or other progressive neurological disorders.
		In this 6-month project we will completely re-design and re-plant their garden based on the patients' needs and wishes, 
		working together with the patients and their visitors.
		
		<br />
		
		Before starting this project with the Astley Ainslie Hospital, I was a patient-engagement volunteer at Cyrenians,
		working with patients who were staying at the acute wards of the 
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/REH/Pages/default.aspx">Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Mental Health</a>.
		Both in the <a href="http://cyrenians.scot/community-and-food/community-gardens/">Royal Edinburgh Community Garden</a>
		which is located on the hospital grounds, and by taking some of the garden with us to the wards.
		
		<br />
		From September to December 2014 I spent 3 months in Bamenda, Cameroon, where I volunteered with 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a>.
