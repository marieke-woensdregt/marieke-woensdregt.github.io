	<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
	<p>
		In my spare time I like to be involved in projects that have to do with community gardens and permaculture. 
		Aside from my PhD I have a post as a sessional worker with the charity  
		<a href="http://cyrenians.scot/">Cyrenians</a>, where I work together with patients of the 
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/AstleyAinslieHospital/Pages/default.aspx">Astley Ainslie Hospital</a> 
		to breathe new life into their hospital garden. This is a rehabilitation hospital for people who have suffered 
		brain injury, a stroke, orthopaedic injuries, limb amputation, or other progressive neurological disorders.
		In this 6-month project we will completely re-design and re-plant their garden based on the patients' needs and wishes, 
		working together with the patients and their visitors.

		Before starting this project with the Astley Ainslie Hospital, I was a patient-engagement volunteer for 
		<a href="http://cyrenians.scot/">Cyrenians</a>,
		where I did nature-based activities with patients who were staying at the acute wards of the 
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/REH/Pages/default.aspx">Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Mental Health</a>.
		Both in the <a href="http://cyrenians.scot/community-and-food/community-gardens/">Royal Edinburgh Community Garden</a>
		which is located on the hospital grounds, and by taking some of the garden with us to the wards.

		From September to December 2014 I spent 3 months in Bamenda, Cameroon, where I volunteered for the NGO 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a>. Better World Cameroon works to promote permaculture 
		practices in rural Cameroon, and to connect modern permaculture knowledge with the traditional practices and know-how
		of small-scale farmers. In rural Cameroon, small-scale vegetable gardens are usually cultivated by women, for cooking
		and for selling at the local market. These women have a wealth of knowledge of 
		For this purpose, Better World Cameroon is creating a permaculture demonstration site: 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/ndanifor-permaculture-ecovillage/"><"Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage">,
		near Alegnwi village in the rural region of Bafut.
		In cultivating the land and building the houses and meeting hall, Better World Cameroon works together with 
		local women's groups, but also with local builders, Bafut council and Bafut Palace.
