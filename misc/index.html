	<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
	<p>
		In my spare time I like to be involved in projects that have to do with community gardens and permaculture. 
		Aside from my PhD I have a post as a sessional worker with the charity  
		<a href="http://cyrenians.scot/">Cyrenians</a>, where I work together with patients of the 
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/AstleyAinslieHospital/Pages/default.aspx">Astley Ainslie Hospital</a> 
		to breathe new life into their hospital garden. This is a rehabilitation hospital for people who suffer from
		acquired brain injury, stroke, orthopaedic injuries, limb amputation, or other progressive neurological disorders.
		In this 6-month project we will re-design and re-plant their hospital garden, which has been neglected over the years, 
		based on the patients' own needs and wishes, while working together with all patients, staff and visitors who feel
		like helping.
		
		<br />
		<br />
		Before starting this project with the Astley Ainslie Hospital, I was a patient-engagement volunteer for 
		<a href="http://cyrenians.scot/">Cyrenians</a>,
		where I did nature-based activities with patients who were staying at the acute wards of the 
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/REH/Pages/default.aspx">Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Mental Health</a>.
		Both in the <a href="http://cyrenians.scot/community-and-food/community-gardens/">Royal Edinburgh Community Garden</a>
		which is located on the hospital grounds, and by taking some of the garden with us to the wards.
		
		<br />
		<br />
		From September to December 2014 I spent 3 months in Bamenda, Cameroon, where I volunteered for the NGO 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a>. Better World Cameroon works to promote permaculture 
		practices in rural Cameroon, and to connect modern permaculture knowledge with the traditional practices and know-how
		of small-scale farmers. For this purpose, Better World Cameroon is creating a permaculture demonstration site: 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/ndanifor-permaculture-ecovillage/">"Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage"</a>,
		near Alegnwi village in the rural region of Bafut. In rural Cameroon, small-scale vegetable gardens are usually 
		cultivated by women, for cooking and for selling at the local market. These women have a wealth of knowledge of the local
		plants, soil and climate, and how these interact. Therefore, in cultivating and doing natural building at 
		Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage, Better World Cameroon works together with a local women's group, 
		but also with local builders, 
		<a href="http://africa.iclei.org/members/members-in-africa/profiled-african-members/bafut-council-cameroon.html">Bafut Council</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.wmf.org/project/bafut-palace">Bafut Palace</a>, natural builder 
		<a href="http://elkecole.com/">Elke Cole</a>,
		and the <a href="https://ecovillage.org/">Global Ecovillage Network</a>.
		As a volunteer for Better World Cameroon I worked in the office in Bamenda for 4 days a week doing all kinds of
		organisational development work, and at the Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage for 2 days a week learning about 
		permaculture, local farming practices and natural building.
