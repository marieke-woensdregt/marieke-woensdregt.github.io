	<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
	<p>
		In my spare time I like to be involved in projects that have to do with community gardens and permaculture. 
		Aside from my PhD I hold a post as sessional 'patient engagement' worker with the charity  
		<a href="http://cyrenians.scot/">Cyrenians</a>, where I work together with patients of two different wards of the  
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/AstleyAinslieHospital/Pages/default.aspx">Astley Ainslie Hospital</a> 
		to breathe new life into their patio gardens. 
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/AstleyAinslieHospital/Pages/default.aspx">Astley Ainslie</a>
		is a rehabilitation hospital at which I work on a ward for patients who have suffered a head injury or stroke, 
		and on a ward for patients who have had a limb amputation.
		In this 6-month project we are re-designing and re-planting their patio gardens based on the patients' own needs and 
		wishes, while at the same time providing patients and their visitors with an opportunity for some nice outdoor 
		(and indoor) activity.
		
		<br />
		<br />
		Before starting this project with the Astley Ainslie Hospital, I was a patient-engagement volunteer for 
		<a href="http://cyrenians.scot/">Cyrenians</a>,
		where I did gardening and other nature-based activities with patients who were staying at the acute wards of the 
		<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/REH/Pages/default.aspx">Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Mental Health</a>.
		Both outside in the <a href="http://cyrenians.scot/community-and-food/community-gardens/">Royal Edinburgh Community Garden</a>
		which is located on the hospital grounds, and inside on the wards, where we brought some of the garden along with us.
		Watch a video about this project below on the left.

		From September to December 2014 I spent three months in Bamenda, Cameroon, where I volunteered for the NGO 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a>. 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a> works to promote permaculture 
		practices in rural Cameroon, and to connect modern permaculture knowledge with the traditional practices and know-how
		of small-scale farmers. For this purpose, <a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a> 
		has a permaculture demonstration site called 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/ndanifor-permaculture-ecovillage/">Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage</a>,
		near Alegnwi village in the rural region of Bafut, and are setting up a cooperative called
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/introducing-betterworld-cameroon/bettercoop-permaculture/"> Better Coop</a>
		to sell the farm's produce.
		In rural Cameroon, small-scale vegetable gardens are usually 
		cultivated by women, for own consumption but also for selling at the local market. These women have a wealth of 
		knowledge of the local plants, soil and climate, and how these interact. Therefore, in cultivating and doing 
		natural building at 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/ndanifor-permaculture-ecovillage/">Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage</a>, 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a> 
		works together with a local women's group, but also with local builders, 
		<a href="http://africa.iclei.org/members/members-in-africa/profiled-african-members/bafut-council-cameroon.html">Bafut Council</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.wmf.org/project/bafut-palace">Bafut Palace</a>, natural builder 
		<a href="http://elkecole.com/">Elke Cole</a>,
		and the <a href="https://ecovillage.org/">Global Ecovillage Network</a>. Watch a video about the work happening at 
		<a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/ndanifor-permaculture-ecovillage/">Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage</a> 
		below on the right.
		As a volunteer for <a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/">Better World Cameroon</a> 
		I worked in the office in Bamenda for 4 days a week doing all kinds of organisational development work, 
		and at the <a href="http://betterworld-cameroon.com/ndanifor-permaculture-ecovillage/">Ndanifor Permaculture Ecovillage</a>
		for 2 days a week learning about permaculture, local farming practices and natural building.
