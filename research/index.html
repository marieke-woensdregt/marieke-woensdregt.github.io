	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>
		In my PhD I use agent-based models to formalise and explore the hypothesis that language and mindreading (a.k.a. theory of mind) may have co-evolved.
		More specifically, I explore under what circumstances such a co-evolution could have come off the ground, 
		given certain sets of assumptions about how agents communicate and learn, and what cognitive biases and external pressures play a role.
		Watch a 3-Minute Thesis talk about my research here:
