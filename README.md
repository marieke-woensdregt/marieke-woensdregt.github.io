## Welcome to my personal website

Here you can find all the HTML and CSS code which I used to generate my personal website: [https://marieke-woensdregt.github.io/](https://marieke-woensdregt.github.io/). I've created it with help of [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).
