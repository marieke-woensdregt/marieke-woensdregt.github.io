# Teaching

## Lecturing & Course development:

-  *Agent-based Cognitive Modelling* (2022): I'm currently developing this new course for the Cognitive Computing track of the Artificial Intelligence masters at Radboud University. I will start teaching it in September 2022. Find more information about this course [here](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/2022/socsci/courses-osiris/ai/sow-mki87-agent-based-cognitive-modelling/).
-  *Language Processing in Python* (2020): Course on the basics of programming in Python for students from various Bachelor programmes (mostly Linguistics and International Business Communication) at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. This was a new course, which I developed from scratch together with [Eric Sanders](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/sanders-e). I developed and delivered the lectures and tutorials for the first half of the course (on the basics of programming in Python), and supported Eric in developing and teaching the second half of the course (more focused on applications for language science).


## Guest lecturing:

- *Why is scaling up models of language evolution hard?* (MSc; 2021, 2022): I delivered this guest lecture together with [Mark Blokpoel](https://markblokpoel.com/), with whom I co-authored [this CogSci 2021 paper](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/021734q4) on the subject. This guest lecture formed part of the MSc course *Cognition & Complexity* which is taught by [Iris van Rooij](https://irisvanrooijcogsci.com/) and [Nils Donselaar](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/donselaar-n) at Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
- *Language Evolution & Social Cognition* (BA; 2021): I delivered this guest lecture as part of the BA course *Leading Questions in Cognition Language & Communication*, which is taught by [Marieke Schouwstra](https://mariekeschouwstra.github.io/) at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
- *Pragmatics and Language Evolution* (BA; 2021): I delivered this guest lecture as part of the BA course *Pragmatics*, which is taught by [Jet Hoek](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/hoek-j) at Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
- *Bayesian learning* and *Iterated Bayesian learning* (MSc; 2018): I delivered this guest lecture as part of the Honours/MSc course *Simulating Language*, taught by [Simon Kirby](https://www.simonkirby.net/) and [Kenny Smith](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/) at the University of Edinburgh, UK.

## Supervision:
- *Research assistantship, Experiments perspective-taking* (MSc; 2021): I was the main supervisor for a research assistantship by MSc student Simon Møller Nielsen for a project titled *Role of perspective-taking in building communicative conventions*, led by myself, with collaborators [Riccardo Fusaroli](https://fusaroli.weebly.com/) and [Kristian Tylén](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/kristian-tylen(9950d8bc-e1cd-400a-a547-359cd0b07157).html). 125 hours to program referential communication experiment and run participants, funded by Seed Funding from the Interacting Minds Centre at Aarhus University, Denmark.
- *Research assistantship, Modelling continuer evolution* (MSc; 2021): I was the main supervisor for a research assistantship by MSc student Jacqueline van Arkel for a project titled *Convergent cultural evolution of continuers*, led by myself and [Mark Dingemanse](https://markdingemanse.net/). 232 hours to program and analyse computational models, funded by the Centre for Language Studies at Radboud University, The Netherlands, 2021.
- *MSc Thesis project, Modelling conversational repair* (MSc; 2020-2021): Together with [Mark Blokpoel](https://markblokpoel.com/), I supervised Jacqueline van Arkel's thesis project titled *How do people resolve misunderstanding in conversation through repair? Introducing a framework built on belief revision and coherence* for her MSc in Human-Machine Communication at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands.
- *MSc Internship project, Modelling conversational repair* (MSc; 2020): Together with [Mark Blokpoel](https://markblokpoel.com/), I supervised Jacqueline van Arkel's internship project titled *Does Other-Initiated Repair Add Efficiency to Communication? An Agent-Based Simulation Extending the Rational Speech Act Framework* for her MSc in Human-Machine Communication at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. This project was published in [this proceedings paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.14/) of the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL).
- *MSc Thesis project, Modelling co-evolution of language and pragmatics* (MSc; 2019): Together with [Simon Kirby](https://www.simonkirby.net/), I supervised Anna Kapron-King for her dissertation project titled *Cultural Co-Evolution of Language and Pragmatic Ability* for her MSc in Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. This project led to a conference abstract that was accepted for a poster presentation at Evolang XIII, 2020.
- *MSc Thesis project, Modelling language and theory of mind* (MSc; 2016): Together with [Kenny Smith](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/), I supervised Yiyun Zhao for her dissertation project titled *Simulating the interaction between mindreading and language in development and evolution* for her MSc in Evolution of Language and Cognition at the University of Edinburgh/
