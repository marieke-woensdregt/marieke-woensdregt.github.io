# Teaching

## Lecturing & Course development:

-  *Agent-based Cognitive Modelling* (2022): I'm currently developing this new course for the Cognitive Computing track of the Artificial Intelligence masters at Radboud University. I will start teaching it in September 2022. Find more information about this course [here](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/2022/socsci/courses-osiris/ai/sow-mki87-agent-based-cognitive-modelling/).
-  *Language Processing in Python* (2020): Course on the basics of programming in Python for students from various Bachelor programmes (mostly Linguistics and International Business Communication) at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. This was a new course, which I developed from scratch together with [Eric Sanders](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/sanders-e). I developed and delivered the lectures and tutorials for the first half of the course (on the basics of programming in Python), and supported Eric in developing and teaching the second half of the course (more focused on applications for language science).


## Guest lecturing:

- *Why is scaling up models of language evolution hard?* (2021, 2022): I delivered this guest lecture together with [Mark Blokpoel](https://markblokpoel.com/), with whom I co-authored [this CogSci 2021 paper](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/021734q4) on the subject. This guest lecture formed part of the MSc course *Cognition & Complexity* which is taught by [Iris van Rooij](https://irisvanrooijcogsci.com/) and [Nils Donselaar](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/donselaar-n) at Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
- *Language Evolution & Social Cognition* (2021): I delivered this guest lecture as part of the BA course *Leading Questions in Cognition Language & Communication*, which is taught by [Marieke Schouwstra](https://mariekeschouwstra.github.io/) at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
- *Pragmatics and Language Evolution* (2021): I delivered this guest lecture as part of the BA course *Pragmatics*, which is taught by [Jet Hoek](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/hoek-j) at Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
- *Bayesian learning* and *Iterated Bayesian learning* (2018): I delivered this guest lecture as part of the Honours course *Simulating Language*, taught by [Simon Kirby](https://www.simonkirby.net/) and [Kenny Smith](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/) at the University of Edinburgh, UK.
