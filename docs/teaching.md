# Teaching

## Lecturing & Course development:

-  *Agent-based Cognitive Modelling*: I'm currently developing this new course for the Cognitive Computing track of the Artificial Intelligence masters at Radboud University. I will start teaching it in September 2022. Find more information about this course [here](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/2022/socsci/courses-osiris/ai/sow-mki87-agent-based-cognitive-modelling/).
-  *Language Processing in Python*: Course on the basics of programming in Python for students from various Bachelor programmes (mostly Linguistics and International Business Communication) at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. This was a new course, which I developed from scratch together with [Eric Sanders](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/sanders-e). I developed and delivered the lectures and tutorials for the first half of the course (on the basics of programming in Python), and supported Eric in developing and teaching the second half of the course (more focused on applications for language science).
