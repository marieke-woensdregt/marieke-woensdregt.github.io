# About me

I'm a computational cognitive scientist who researches the interplay between language, inference, social cognition, and social interaction. [**Find my CV here**](/assets/cv_M_Woensdregt.pdf). Language use relies on (i) flexible inferencing skills (e.g. to combine linguistic knowledge and background knowledge to infer the meaning of a novel word like mask-shaming); (ii) socio-cognitive skills such as theory of mind (e.g., to decide whether to talk about the house or a house), and (iii) interactional skills (e.g., to ask for clarification). I use computational modelling to tackle challenging questions about these capacities and their interplay.
